# Reference Architecture

The `FlyWheel Effect` describes the tactical use of incremental — in isolation sometimes meanigless — work, to create an _unstoppable_ momentum over time. The purpose of this project is to present a _hands-on_ end-to-end system architecture that designs for this effect by focusing on delivering _intelligent product features_ through the leverage of _data value chains_. Hence, it should support lateral cross-team collaboration between domain experts, product designers, data / machine learning and product engineers.

Herein this architecture study strongly focuses on guiding small- to mid-sized (project) teams in the _creation of integrated none-CRUD Experiences and "Data" products_:

- developer experience / 0 min onboarding
- design systems
- shift left DevOps
- event systems
- analytics
- data processing / machine learning pipelines
- google style mono-repo approach
- trunk-based development CI/CD workflow
- ...
